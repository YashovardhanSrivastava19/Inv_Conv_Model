# Inv_Conv_Model
A Deep Learning Model by combining Covolutional  an Involutional Neural Networks.

In-Conv Model is an attempt to combine Involution and Convolutional Neural Network. 

Involutional Kerenl is both location specific and channel-agnostic. Convolution, on the other
hand is location-agnostic and channel specific.

In-Conv model combines these orthagonal properties to experiment with the CIFAR10 dataset.

Feel free to experiment.
